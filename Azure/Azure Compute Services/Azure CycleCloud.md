# Azure CycleCloud

[toc]

## Overview
- Orchestrate and manage high-performance computing (HPC) environments on Azure.
- Enables you to provision infrastructure for HPC systems,  deploy familiar HPC schedulers, and scale the infrastructure  automatically to run jobs efficiently at any scale.
## Features
  - **Scheduler Agnostic** – use standard HPC schedulers or extend CycleCloud autoscaling plugins to work with your own scheduler.
  - **Manage Compute Resources** – manage VMs and scale sets to provide a set of compute resources to meet your workload requirements.
  - **Autoscale Resources** – adjust cluster size and components automatically based on workload, availability, and time requirements.
  - **Monitor and Analyze** – collect node-level metrics and analyze the performance data using a visualization tool.
  - **Template Clusters** – enables you to share your cluster topologies.
  - CycleCloud agent (called Jetpack)
    - Node Configuration
    - Distributed Synchronization
    - Health Check
