# Azure Active Directory B2B



[toc]

## Overview



- Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) business-to-business (B2B)  collaboration is a feature within External Identities that lets you  invite guest users to collaborate with your organization
- With B2B collaboration, you can securely share your company's  applications and services with guest users from any other organization,  while maintaining control over your own corporate data
- With Azure AD B2B, the partner uses their own identity management  solution, so there is no external administrative overhead for your  organization; they are invited via the AD portal
- Create a new guest user similar to creating any other user, assign them to apps or groups and then send an invitation email
- Guest **user access restrictions** can be used to restrict guest access
