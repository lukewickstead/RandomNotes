# Privileged Identity Management (PIM)

[toc]

## Overview

- Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is a service in Azure Active  Directory (Azure AD) that enables you to manage, control, and monitor  access to important resources in your organization
- These resources  include resources in Azure AD, Azure, and other Microsoft Online  Services such as Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Intune



## Reasons to use

Organizations want to minimize the number of people who have access  to secure information or resources, because that reduces the chance of a malicious actor getting that access, or an authorized user  inadvertently impacting a sensitive resource. However, users still need  to carry out privileged operations in Azure AD, Azure, Microsoft 365, or SaaS apps. Organizations can give users just-in-time privileged access  to Azure resources and Azure AD. There is a need for oversight for what  those users are doing with their administrator privileges



## What does it do?

Privileged Identity Management provides time-based and approval-based role activation to mitigate the risks of excessive, unnecessary, or  misused access permissions on resources that you care about. Here are  some of the key features of Privileged Identity Management:

- Provide **just-in-time** privileged access to Azure AD and Azure resources
- Assign **time-bound** access to resources using start and end dates
- Require **approval** to activate privileged roles
- Enforce **multi-factor authentication** to activate any role
- Use **justification** to understand why users activate
- Get **notifications** when privileged roles are activated
- Conduct **access reviews** to ensure users still need roles
- Download **audit history** for internal or external audit
