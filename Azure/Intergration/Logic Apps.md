## Logic Apps



[toc]

## Overview

-  is a cloud service that helps you schedule, automate, and orchestrate tasks, business processes, and [workflows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview#logic-app-concepts) when you need to integrate apps, data, systems, and services across  enterprises or organizations
- Logic Apps simplifies how you design and  build scalable solutions for app [integration](https://azure.microsoft.com/product-categories/integration/), data integration, system integration, enterprise application integration (EAI), and business-to-business (B2B) communication, whether in the cloud, on premises, or both
- For example, here are just a few workloads you can automate with logic apps
  - Process and route orders across on-premises systems and cloud services
  - Send email notifications with Office 365 when events happen in various systems, apps, and services
  - Move uploaded files from an SFTP or FTP server to Azure Storage
  - Monitor tweets for a specific subject, analyze the sentiment, and create alerts or tasks for items that need review
- Build your workflow using a logic app designer
- Build your wokflow using many predefined templates
- Logic Apps uses consumption-based [pricing and metering](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing) unless you have logic apps previously created with App Service plans
- Components
  - **Workflow** helps you create a series of steps for your logic app
  - **Managed connectors** allow you to access and work with your data
  - **Trigger** is the first step to run your logic app; fires when a specific event happens
  - **Actions** are steps that happen after the trigger and perform tasks in the workflow of your logic app
  - **Enterprise Integration Pack** allows you to create an automated, scalable enterprise integration workflow
- Connectors provide quick access to events, data and actions across other apps, services, systems, protocols and platforms
  - There are hundreds of predefined connectors
  - You can create your own connector which can be reused by any other Logic App
