# Azure CapEx vs. OpEx

[toc]

## Overview

### Capital Expenditure (CapEx)

- Upfront cost on physical infrastructure
- You need to plan your expenses at the start of a project or budget period

### Operational Expenditure (OpEx)

- No upfront cost but you pay for the service/product as you use it
- OpEx is particularly appealing if the demand fluctuates or is unknown
