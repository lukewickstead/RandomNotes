# Azure Cloud Service Models

[toc]

## Overview

- The three cloud computing service models are **IaaS, PaaS,** and **SaaS**.
- You can also use **serverless computing** to eliminate the need to manage infrastructure.
- IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS have different levels of managed services:

## Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

- Most user management
- You are responsible for managing the **operating systems, data,** and **applications.**
- IaaS helps you to extend resources rapidly to meet the spikes required for your application.
- Used in the following scenarios:
  - **Migrating workloads – move existing applications to the cloud.**
  - **Test and development** – quickly set up and  dismantle test and development environments. IaaS makes scaling  development and testing environments, fast and economical.
  - **Storage, backup, and recovery** – simplify the planning and management of backup and recovery systems.
  - **Website hosting** – less expensive than traditional web hosting.
  - **High-performance computing (HPC)** – clusters of computers that help solve complex problems involving millions of variables or calculations.
  - **Big data analysis** – for massive data sets that require a huge amount of processing power

## Platform as a service (PaaS)

- Less user management
- The operating systems are managed by the cloud provider, while the user is responsible for the applications and data they run and  store.
- PaaS offers all the functionality you need to support the entire lifecycle of web applications: **building, testing the application**, **deploying the source code**, **managing**, and **updating** within the same integrated environment.
- Used in the following scenarios:
  - **Development framework** – a framework for creating or customizing cloud-based applications.
  - **Analytics or business intelligence** – find insights and patterns, and predict outcomes to improve business decisions.

## Software as a service (SaaS)

- Least amount of management
- The cloud provider is responsible for managing everything, and the end-user just uses the software.

## Serverless Computing

- Function as a Service (FaaS)
- You simply deploy the code with a serverless platform, and it runs at high availability.
- Dynamically scales up and down to meet the demands of each workload within seconds.
- A **pay-per-execution model** that charges sub-second billing only for the time and resources required to execute the code.
