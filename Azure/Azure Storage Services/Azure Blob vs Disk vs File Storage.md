# Azure Blob vs Disk vs File Storage
|                              | **Blob Storage**                                             | **Disk Storage**                                             | **File Storage**                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Type of storage**          | Object storage to store all types of data formats.           | Block storage for virtual machines.                          | File system across multiple machines.                        |
| **Max Storage Size**         | Same as maximum storage account capacity                     | 65,536 GiB for ultra disk 32,767 GiB for standard and premium drives | Scale up to 100 TiB                                          |
| **Max File Size**            | 190.7 TiB for block blob 195 GiB for append blob 8 TiB for page blob | Equivalent to the maximum size of your volumes               | 4 TiB for a single file                                      |
| **Performance (Throughput)** | 500 requests per second for a single blob                    | Up to 2000 MBps per disk.                                    | 6,204 MiB/s for egress 4,136 MiB/s for ingress               |
| **Data Accessing**           | Objects can be accessed via HTTP/HTTPs.                      | A single virtual machine in a single AZ.                     | Share your files either on-premises or in the cloud.         |
| **Encryption Methods**       | Encrypt your data using Azure SSE (256-bit AES)              | SSE by storage service and ADE for OS and data disks.        | Encrypt your data using Azure SSE (256-bit AES)              |
| **Backup and Restoration**   | Versioning, snapshots and object replication                 | You can back up your managed disks at any point in time using snapshots. | Uses file share snapshots                                    |
| **Pricing**                  | You are billed based on the stored data per month, operations performed, data transfer, and redundancy. | You pay for the disk size, snapshots, and number of transactions. | You pay for the provisioned GiB per month and the number of servers connected to the cloud endpoint. |
| **Use Cases**                | Static website, media and log files, backups, analytics workloads | Boot volumes and transaction-intensive workloads             | Central location of your files, monitoring logs and applications |
